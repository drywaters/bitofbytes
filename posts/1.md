## Warming up...{ .text-2xl }

Every project needs a landing spot for the ideas, reminders, and troubleshooting
notes that accumulate along the way. BitOfBytes is becoming that place. I want
this space to double as a lab notebook for things I am learning and a quick
reference library for future me. Expect to see walkthroughs of the little tools
that power my daily workflow, hard-earned lessons from production debugging, and
links to external resources that deserve more than a browser bookmark.

## What to expect next

I am in the process of wiring up a handful of simple utilities—think Base64 and
hashing helpers, TLS certificate snippets, and other pocket references that are
constantly useful yet annoyingly easy to forget. As those land, I will write up
why they exist, how they are implemented, and what pitfalls to watch for when
you adapt them to your own projects.

## Why write it down?

Taking the time to capture these details is the best way I know to make sure the
information sticks. By putting context around each snippet or command, the posts
become more than a copy/paste repository—they become a map through the problem,
with breadcrumbs that make it easier to retrace the route later.
