# Base64 Utility Improvement Ideas

The current Base64 helper lives in [`models/base64.go`](../models/base64.go) and is surfaced through the `/utils/base64` routes.  The service is intentionally simple—encoding uses `base64.StdEncoding` and decoding trims leading and trailing whitespace before calling `StdEncoding.Decode`.  If you need to extend this utility in the future, the following ideas may help you scope the work.

## API and UX enhancements

- **Support multiple encodings.** `encoding/base64` also ships URL-safe, raw (unpadded), and custom encodings.  Exposing a selector in the UI and swapping the encoder/decoder would make the tool more flexible, especially when working with JWTs or URL query parameters.
- **Auto-detect padding.** Today the decoder requires correct padding.  We could attempt to auto-fix missing padding by adding the necessary `=` characters before decoding, improving UX for copy-pasted values.
- **Preserve newlines.** The current implementation trims surrounding whitespace but keeps internal newlines.  Allowing users to toggle between wrapped (e.g., MIME-style) and unwrapped output would support more workflows.

## Robustness and scalability

- **Streaming interfaces.** Encoding and decoding happen entirely in memory.  For very large payloads (file uploads), consider piping through `base64.NewEncoder` / `NewDecoder` and streaming to `io.Writer`s to reduce allocations.
- **Configurable size limits.** `maxBase64DecodeLen` is hard-coded to 4 KiB.  Hooking this into configuration (e.g., environment variable) or deriving a safe upper bound from request limits would let deployments tune the guardrail.
- **Improved error messages.** Decode errors bubble up from the standard library without context.  Wrapping them or mapping to user-friendly strings (invalid character, padding issue, unexpected newline, etc.) would make debugging easier.

## Testing and tooling

- **Golden tests for edge cases.** Add table-driven tests covering different encodings, padding scenarios, whitespace variations, and size-limit violations to prevent regressions as features evolve.
- **Benchmark critical paths.** Introduce Go benchmarks for `Encode`/`Decode` (especially if you add streaming) to keep an eye on allocation counts and latency.
- **Fuzz decoding.** Go's built-in fuzzing can help ensure the decoder rejects malformed input gracefully without panicking or hanging.

Keeping these options documented should save future contributors from rediscovering them when enhancing the Base64 utility.
